          They're highly engaging. Social networks tend to keep people coming
          back and sharing content, which means you don't need to work so hard
          on creating your own.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are excellent channels for advertising. Your website will have a
          captive audience that often visits and is eager to provide personal
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can develop a vibrant community. The likelihood that two people
          will become closer increases with time spent together.

          <b><u>A Domain Name</u></b
          >- Every website needs its own domain, and social networks are no
          exception. You just need to find a registrar or hosting service you
          trust, and identify which domain you want. Once you find the perfect
          domain, you'll need to register it by filling out a few forms and
          paying for at least a year in advance.

          <b><u>Scalable Hosting</u></b
          >- Aside from a domain, you'll also need someplace to host your social
          network. Since you're starting from scratch, shared hosting should do
          for a while. The process of signing up for a hosting plan is simple.
          You just pick the one you want, fill out a few forms, and pay for at
          least a month in advance - just as with domains. If you're not sure
          where to start, check out our shared hosting plans. They're optimized
          for speed, so your social network will be in good hands.
